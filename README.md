Picture of the MSP430FR4133 microcontroller. There are three onboard push buttons (P1.2 and P2.6 are labelled) and an LCD screen. The LCD screen is used to display the user interface in which the user uses the onboard push buttons to navigate. The ground pin and one of the GPIO pins are used to connect to the buzzer for alarm functionality.
